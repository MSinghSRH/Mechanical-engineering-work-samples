# Mechanical CAD Portfolio

This repository presents a collection of mechanical design projects created during my engineering studies - Graduate and Post Graduate included. The work is categorized into two groups based on the software tools and project scope.

---

## Autodesk Inventor Projects

**Project Types:** Parts and Assemblies  
**Software Used:** Autodesk Inventor  
**Project Scope** Technical Drawing Interpretation, Solid Modeling, Assembly Design

These projects include individual parts and assemblies modeled using Autodesk Inventor. All designs were constructed based on provided technical drawings with emphasis to dimensional accuracy and modeling constraints.

> These models do not include any simulation or finite element analysis, but are ready for such.

## CATIA Projects

**Project Types:** Modeled Components with Simulation  
**Software Used:** CATIA (for modeling and simulation)  
**Project Scope** CAD Modeling, Finite Element Analysis, Mechanical Behavior Simulation

This section features parts modeled in CATIA and subsequently analyzed for mechanical stress, deformation, and performance under realistic conditions. These projects demonstrate results of mechanical analysis and simulation workflows.

## Visual Previews

> Wherever possible, rendered images and screenshots of parts, assemblies, and simulations are included for quick reference.

## Notes

- These projects were completed as part of academic coursework in CAD and mechanical simulation modules.
- Original technical drawings provided during the assignments are included in this repository wherever possible.
- All files are organized and labeled for clarity and ease of navigation.
